# Taxi-Organization-Analysis---Power-BI-Dashboard

## Overview
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing taxi service operations over three months (May-July 2024). This project identifies key revenue patterns, trip behavior, driver efficiency, and external impacts (weather, surge pricing) while providing data-driven recommendations to optimize performance. The interactive dashboard enables stakeholders to make informed decisions to enhance operations and customer experience.

## Dashboard Features
- Executive Summary with KPIs: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total trips, average fare, and passenger count.
- Revenue Analysis: Breakdown by time, location, surge pricing, and payment type.
- Customer Segmentation & Trip Purpose Analysis: Identifies everyday trip purposes and passenger behavior.
- Weather & Traffic Impact Metrics: Evaluate how external factors influence trip duration and revenue.
- Driver Efficiency Metrics: Performance assessment based on trip frequency, average trip time, and revenue contribution.

## Key Insights
